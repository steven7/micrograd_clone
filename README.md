# micrograd_clone

A collections of classes that implement a Neural Network from scratch. The value class contains the value of one neuron including its gradient. It performs the calculations needed for back propagation.  The Value class is then wrapped in a neuron class. The input weights, bias and output are all included in this. The neuron is in turn wrapped in the layer class that contains all of the neurons of one layer. This is turn is wrapped in the multi layer perception
