# micrograd_clone
A collections of classes that implement a Neural Network from scratch. The value class contains the value of one neuron including its gradient. It performs the calculations needed for back propagation.  The Value class is then wrapped in a Neuron class which is in turn wrapped in the Layer class which is in turn wrapped in the MLP class.
